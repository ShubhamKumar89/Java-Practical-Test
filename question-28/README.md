**PROGRAM EXPLANATION**

1. Input and Output are the two text fields for input of string and output of the key action respectively.
2. The program demonstrates the functions of the KeyListener interface.
a) When the key is released, the keyReleased function is called which displays the unicode of the key and if the key is a valid letter then calls the method keyTyped.
b) When the key is pressed, the keyPressed function is called which displays the unicode of the key and if the key is a valid letter then calls the method keyTyped.
c) When the key is typed, the keyTyped function is called which displays the character representation of the key pressed.
3. The @Override keyword overrides the functions of the parent class and executes the functions of sub class.
